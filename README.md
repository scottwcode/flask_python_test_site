## Test Flask Website with Python Code

This repo contains test Python Code displayed in a website using Flask

### To run the code locally where it can be viewed from a browser; in a terminal session from the same directory/folder as the flask_test_site.py file, type the following:

> python flask_test_site.py

This will serve the code in localhost. There will be several messages, with one saying where the site is running (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/). CMD-Click that url which will open your default browser with the url. From the browser, add /admin to the end of the url (http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin) to execute the code.
